    "At the inception of the [Ontario Birth Study](http://www.ontariobirthstudy.ca) in 2013, clinical data was stored on a [Medidata Rave](https://www.medidata.com/en/products/edc/) database which was housed at the [Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC)](https://www.stmichaelshospital.com/research/ahrc/) at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital. Medidata Rave was used as it was believed that the Ontario Birth Study data would be associated with the [Ontario Health Study](https://www.ontariohealthstudy.ca/). Since the Ontario Birth Study is no longer associated with the Ontario Health Study and there were significant limitations with the Medidata Rave database, the Ontario Birth Study decided to move the clinical database from Medidata Rave to [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) in late 2019. Both the Medidata Rave and REDCap database were developed by AHRC; however, the data transfer was done independently of ARHC. \r\n",

    "This notebook outlines the data migration process from Medidata Rave to REDCap completed in May 2020. The process outlined attempts to maximize data fidelity during data migration with minimal data cleaning - it was anticipated that the data cleaning process would be done at a later date. Therefore, for the purposes of this project, it was assumed that all Medidata Rave data received from AHRC was correct (i.e. no checking between label and coded data).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Although both the Medidata Rave and REDCap database were created by AHRC, there were differences in format and the numeric coding of variables. The Rave data was given to the Ontario Birth Study in a wide format while the REDCap data needs to be in a long format to successfully import (see [Wide and narrow data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) for a description). Some columns, specifically date columns, forced the person entering the data to input a value even if one was not available. These instances had to be reinterpreted so the REDCap data reflected the intentions of the source data."

    "The Rave database captures data in a wide format whereas the REDCap data is a long/narrow format. The `RedcapConv` class from `obs_clinic_migration` was created to aid in the conversion from wide to long. The intializing of `RedcapConv` takes the following parameters: `ravestub_redcap_dict`, `stub_repeat`, `master_df`, `redcap_data_dict`, and, `recode_long`.\r\n",
    "- `ravestub_redcap_dict` maps the name of the variable in REDCap to the associated variable in Rave.\r\n",
    "- `stub_repeat` parameter is the number of occurences in the Rave dataset. For example if there is 'parameter_1' and 'parameter_2', the stub_repeat would be set to 2.\r\n",
    "- `master_df` is the reference data frame that is being convert - in this case it is the Rave dataframe which will be converted to the REDCap format.\r\n",
    "- `redcap_data_dict` is the data dictionary derived from REDCap and lists the coding of variables\r\n",
    "- `recode_long` is a boolean which will recode the Rave data set (i.e. `master_df`) to the REDCap values using based on `redcap_data_dict`\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The function works by identifying the columns of interest in the Rave clinic database. For example, suppose we are interested in the Rave columns 'rave_column_a' and 'rave_column_b'. Two Rave columns are availble in the Rave data set: one with the data uncoded (i.e. represented as a string), another representing the data numerically coded. In the Rave data set, the column representing the data numerically coded ended in 'STD' (e.g. 'rave_parameter_a_STD'). "
